Reflection for P6

1. Different data structures have different complexity. This exercise is useful for us in the future to determine 
which data structure is better for certain tasks.

2. SinglyLinkedList is one-way list - .next to call the current.next
   doublelinkedlist have before/after pointer, so if we want to add or remove on index, we need to reset both direction.
 
3. drawing the graph on the paper/board helps a lot

4. when working on difficult tasks like chunkylisk, we need to consider different case
	that is to say, if/else statement became very important
	
5. for loop for node is a tricky one, we need to pay attention to the iteration steps.
	For example, when to break the loop, is it current != null or current.next != null
	
6. checkisempty() is efficient. we need to check the condition for almost every method we wrote
	it is useful and more efficient if we create boolean method, instead of checking it every time
	
7. In chunkylist, if why cant null has index

8. when we remove some elements in chunkylist, if there is no element in a chunk, we better delelted the chunks(node0
	because it is not good to leave empty node into it .
	
9. there is no O(N^3) at least in P6, if there is three O(N) method, the sum is 0(n+n+n) not O(n^3)

10. I am glad I started writing the program early. so I dont panic out this weekend.
